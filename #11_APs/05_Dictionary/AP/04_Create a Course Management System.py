Task Objective:
‚Ä¢ Create a nested dictionary named course_data to manage university course enrollments.
‚Ä¢ Store structured details like instructor, credits, and enrolled_students.
‚Ä¢ Modify the student list and course details.
‚Ä¢ Add a new course with complete data.
‚Ä¢ Access data from a course that may not exist using the get() method.

üìù Instructions:
‚Ä¢ Define a dictionary named course_data with at least two courses: CS101 and MATH123.
  - Each should store:
    ‚Ä¢ instructor (string)
    ‚Ä¢ credits (int)
    ‚Ä¢ enrolled_students (list of strings)
‚Ä¢ Add a new student to the enrolled_students list for CS101.
‚Ä¢ Update the number of credits for MATH123.
‚Ä¢ Add a new course PHY202 with full details.
‚Ä¢ Print the entire updated dictionary.
‚Ä¢ Use the get() method to check if a course BIO150 exists and return "Course not available" if not.

üí° Sample Output:

Updated CS101: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']  
Updated MATH123 credits: 4  
Added course PHY202: {'instructor': 'Dr. Lee', 'credits': 3, 'enrolled_students': ['Sam', 'Nina']}

Full Course Data:  
{'CS101': {'instructor': 'Dr. Smith', 'credits': 3, 'enrolled_students': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']},  
 'MATH123': {'instructor': 'Dr. Brown', 'credits': 4, 'enrolled_students': ['Tom']},  
 'PHY202': {'instructor': 'Dr. Lee', 'credits': 3, 'enrolled_students': ['Sam', 'Nina']}}

BIO150: Course not available
