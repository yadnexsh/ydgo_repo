"""
‚úÖ Task Objective:

‚Ä¢ Use the input() function to collect user data.
‚Ä¢ Store the inputs in variables using correct naming conventions.
‚Ä¢ Combine first and last names into a single variable.
‚Ä¢ Print all values clearly using the print() function.
‚Ä¢ Use the type() function to display the data type of each variable.
‚Ä¢ Use the len() function to calculate the number of characters in the full name.
‚Ä¢ Perform an arithmetic operation on the age value to show the age after 5 years.

üõ†Ô∏è Instructions:

1. Prompt the user to enter:
   ‚Ä¢ First name
   ‚Ä¢ Last name
   ‚Ä¢ Age
   ‚Ä¢ City of residence

2. Combine the first and last name into one variable called `full_name`.

3. Print the following with clear labels:
   ‚Ä¢ Full name
   ‚Ä¢ Age
   ‚Ä¢ City

4. Use the `type()` function to print the data type of each variable.

5. Use the `len()` function to:
   ‚Ä¢ Calculate the number of characters in the full name.
   ‚Ä¢ Print the character count.

6. Convert the `age` input to a number.
   ‚Ä¢ Add 5 to it.
   ‚Ä¢ Print the result as the future age.

7. Use meaningful variable names following the `snake_case` convention.

üñ•Ô∏è Sample Output:

Enter your first name: Alice  
Enter your last name: Smith  
Enter your age: 25  
Enter your city of residence: Toronto

Full Name: Alice Smith
